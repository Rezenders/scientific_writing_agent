# Full Manuscript Audit

Full-manuscript pre-submission audit. Orchestrates all review agents across every section and produces a unified GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO report. Use before `/pre-submission` to catch issues early.

## Section Map

Use the project-specific section map in `.agents/context/paper-model.md`. If it still contains placeholders, derive the active section list from `<MAIN_TEX>` before auditing.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Annotation Inventory

Run `/find-annotations` to list all open annotation macros documented in `AGENTS.md` or `.agents/context/terminology.md`. Report count and location.

### Phase 2 — Full Consistency Audit

Use `.agents/agents/consistency-auditor.md` on the full manuscript. Check:
- macro and terminology drift using `.agents/context/terminology.md`;
- acronym consistency (first use, subsequent use);
- contribution-statement alignment (introduction vs. body vs. conclusion);
- project-specific ambiguous terms and distinctions;
- experimental setup descriptions versus reported results;
- cross-section contradictions.

### Phase 3 — Section-by-Section Scientific Review

Use `.agents/agents/scientific-paper-reviewer.md` on each section. Flag critical issues only — skip minor style notes for speed.

### Phase 4 — Implementation Spot-Check

Use `.agents/agents/paper-implementation-checker.md` on high-risk implementation-dependent claims listed in `.agents/context/claim-ledger.md`, `.agents/context/evaluation-claims.md`, or the target sections. Focus on claims about runtime behavior, interfaces, generated artifacts, experiment scripts, data processing, and quantitative results.

### Phase 5 — Unified Report

```
## Full Manuscript Audit

### Open Annotations
[Count and location summary]

### Critical Issues (block submission)
[Merged findings from Phases 2–4, ordered by section]

### Medium Issues (should fix)
[...]

### Per-Section Verdicts
| Section | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Introduction | READY / NEEDS REVISION / MAJOR ISSUES |
| ... | ... |

### Overall Verdict
GO | CONDITIONAL GO | NO-GO
```

## Constraints

- Do not edit any files during this workflow.
- Do not propose rewrites inline — use `/write-to-intent` or `/technical-paragraph-rewrite` after this audit.
- Related skills: `/section-review` for a single section, `/pre-submission` for the final submission checklist.
