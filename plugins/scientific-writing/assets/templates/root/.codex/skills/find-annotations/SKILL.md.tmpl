# Find Annotations

Scan all `.tex` files for inline annotation commands and report them grouped by type.

## Annotation Commands

- `\todo{}`
- `\revise{}`
- `\red{}`

## Workflow

Run a repository-wide search across `.tex` files for the annotation commands above.

Group the results by annotation type and report:

- file and line number
- full annotation content where practical

## Output Format

```text
### \todo (N open)
- introduction.tex:42 - add citation for claim about X

### \revise (N open)
- evaluation.tex:73 - this paragraph is too vague

### \red (N open)
- approach.tex:55 - CHECK: is this still accurate after last refactor?

Total: N annotations across M files.
```

If none are found, report: `No open annotations - manuscript is clean.`
