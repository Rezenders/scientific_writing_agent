# Full Manuscript Audit

Full-manuscript pre-submission audit. Orchestrates all review agents and produces a unified go/no-go report.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Annotation Inventory

Run `/find-annotations` across all manuscript files. Report open annotation count, section distribution, and any blocking items.

### Phase 2 — Full Consistency Audit

Use `.codex/agents/consistency-auditor.md` on the full manuscript. Check: terminology drift, acronym consistency, contribution-statement alignment, and cross-section contradictions.

### Phase 3 — Section-by-Section Scientific Review

Use `.codex/agents/scientific-paper-reviewer.md` on each section. Flag critical issues only (skip minor style notes for speed).

### Phase 4 — Implementation Spot-Check *(optional)*

Use `.codex/agents/paper-implementation-checker.md` on the highest-risk claims. Skip if not configured.

### Phase 5 — Unified Report

Combine findings into a single report with: open annotations, critical issues, medium issues, per-section verdicts, implementation findings, recommended fix order, and overall GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO verdict.

## Constraints

- Do not edit any files. Report only.
- Use `/write-to-intent` or `/technical-paragraph-rewrite` after this audit to fix findings.
