# Paper Build

Build and validate the manuscript from the repository root.

## Steps

1. Run `make pdf`.
2. Scan the build output for fatal LaTeX errors, especially lines beginning with `!`.
3. Report success or failure for the output PDF.
4. Run `make lint`.
5. Group `chktex` warnings by file, ignoring warning types suppressed in `AGENTS.md`.
6. Report undefined references or missing citations if they appear in the logs.
