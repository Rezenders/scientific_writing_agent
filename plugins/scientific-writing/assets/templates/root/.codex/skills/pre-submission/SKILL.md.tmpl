# Pre-Submission Checklist

Run every step in order. Do not skip later steps because earlier ones passed.

## Steps

### 1. Build

Run `make pdf`.

### 2. Lint

Run `make lint`.

### 3. Open Annotations

Use `.codex/skills/find-annotations/SKILL.md`.

### 4. Consistency Audit

Use `.codex/agents/consistency-auditor.md`.

### 5. Implementation Alignment Spot-Check

Use `.codex/agents/paper-implementation-checker.md` on the highest-risk claims if your paper has an associated implementation.

## Constraints

- Do not edit files while running this workflow unless the user explicitly switches from review to fixing.
- Do not mark the manuscript as `GO` if any non-optional step fails.
