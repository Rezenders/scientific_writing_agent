# Technical Paragraph Rewrite

Workflow for verifying a technical paragraph against the implementation, then generating rewrite options without editing the file before approval.

## Implementation Reference Paths

| What to verify | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Type names, data structures, schemas | `<path>` |
| Running examples referenced in the paper | `<path>` |
| Runtime behavior, interface method names | `<path>` |
| Design intent / architecture documentation | `<path>` |

## Workflow

### Phase 1 - Implementation Check

Use `.codex/agents/paper-implementation-checker.md` on the paragraph and the most relevant implementation file.

### Phase 2 - Scientific Review Of Findings

Use `.codex/agents/scientific-paper-reviewer.md` to evaluate the paragraph and the implementation findings, then identify 2 to 3 revision approaches.

### Phase 3 - First Round Of Suggestions

Use `.codex/agents/writer.md` to produce 2 to 3 alternative rewrites.

### Phase 4 - Review The Suggestions

Use `.codex/agents/scientific-paper-reviewer.md` to compare the proposals and identify the strongest one plus remaining issues.

### Phase 5 - Refined Proposals

Use `.codex/agents/writer.md` again to refine the proposals.

### Phase 6 - Hold For Approval

Present the proposals clearly and stop. Do not edit the manuscript until the user explicitly approves one.
